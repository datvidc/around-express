# Around the U.S. Front End + Back End





## Project 13 
Project 13 in the web developer bootcamp @Yandex {Practicum}

This project introduces database and database concepts. 

Server is setup from project 12, but instead of using the Yandex API, we are now building our own api service, and connecting to a MongoDB. 

WE are completely disconnnecting the API from the frontEnd. Frontend is now removed from this project. 





## Project 12 - 
Project 12 in the web developer bootcamp @Yandex Practicum

This is the first project to touch on the backend. 

This project is about setting up the backend and connecting it to the output of the previous projects. 

### Technologies and methodologies
React framework was used to complete the frontend part of the project. 

- Create React App for scaffolding and bootstrapping the project.


## Directories

`/public` — static files from the build of the React front-end app.

`/data` — JSON files to temporarily emulate database integration.

`/routes` — routing files.

All other directories are optional and may be created by the developer if necessary. 

## Running the Project 

`npm run start` — to launch the server.

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.

`sudo systemctl start mongod` - to Launch MongoDb 
`sudo systemctl status mongod` - to verify that MongoDB is running.
